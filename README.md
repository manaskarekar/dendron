## Dendron - Conway's Game of Life

Version 0.0.3

I stumbled upon Conway's Game Of Life recently and got obssessed with it, I had initially done a terminal based version in Python, but I wanted to play around with SFML (not python bindings) and so I did this in C++.

Lots of improvements to be made. And I'm aware of at least a couple of buggy behaviors.

Watching the game unfold is a lot of fun, and I think I could keep doing it for hours.

Here's a sample video of a 67x67 non-wrapping grid, seeded with an R-Pentonimo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azRhmWiKj7A
