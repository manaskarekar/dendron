## Dendron - Game of Life v0.0.1

I stumbled upon this recently and got obssessed with it, I had initially done a terminal based version in python, but I wanted to play around with SFML and so I picked this up. 

Lot's of improvements that can (and will?) be made. And I'm aware of at least a couple of buggy behaviors.

Watching the game unfold is a lot of fun, and I think I could keep doing it for hours.
