# Notes / Thoughts

- Regarding multidimensional vectors, think about how to handle vectors of vectors that change size. This is not the same as an array.
- Allow seeding by clicking on cells.
- Generalization: Perhaps, allow more than two states. (So multiple colors for examples)
- Instead of drawing each rectangle, load one image for each state and reuse.
- Like the python version, just create a for-x-for-y fn that you pass different operations to.
- Write a tool to implement the Game of Life pattern recorder that records unique patterns and then you can inspect them later.
- Make shapes Class that you could specify the "center/origin" to and it would be placed on the grid relative to the center.
